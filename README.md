# FinancialPlanner

## Description
An application that will help the user visualise their future networth, depending on various variables such as:
1. Current Salary
2. Portfolio
3. Salary Hike cycles
4. Promition Job Switches
5. Expenses
Given values for the above things, the user should be able to see their networth, at age X.


## Features (Sprint #1)
NOTE: We will be agile and start with one simple feature, then improve it around that by extending it.
1. SIP Calculator with inflation adjusted: The user will enter initial investment, monthly sip amount, expected CAGR, time duration, and inflation rate. The app will show final amount after time duration adjusted for inflation.
2. SWP Caclulator: The user will enter a portfolios value, and monthly amount they want to withdraw from it. The app will tell them how many years it will last
